# CLJ-2253

This library implements a workaround for [CLJ-2253](https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-2253).  Simply require (or use) this namespace before using `slurp` and you're done.

## Installation

CLJ-2253 is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/org.pmonks/clj-2253).
Plonk the following in your project.clj :dependencies, `lein deps` and you should be good to go:

```clojure
[org.clojars.pmonks/clj-2253 "#.#.#"]   ; Where #.#.# is replaced with an actual version number
```

The latest released version is:

### Trying it Out
Alternatively, you may prefer to kick the library's tyres without creating a project.  This is a snap with the awesome [`lein try` plugin](https://github.com/rkneufeld/lein-try):

```shell
$ lein try org.clojars.pmonks/clj-2253 "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

You will be dropped in a REPL with the library downloaded and ready for use.

## Usage

The functionality is provided by a single namespace, `CLJ-2253`, that will work its hacky magic as soon as its loaded.

Require it in the REPL (incl. a `lein try` REPL):

```clojure
(require '[CLJ-2253])
```

Require it in your project:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [CLJ-2253]))
```
