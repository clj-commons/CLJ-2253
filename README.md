# CLJ-2253

This library implements a workaround for [CLJ-2253](https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-2253).  Simply require (or use) this namespace before using `slurp` and you're done.

## Installation

CLJ-2253 is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/clj-commons/clj-2253).  The latest released version is:

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/clj-commons/clj-2253.svg)](https://clojars.org/clj-commons/clj-2253)

### Trying it Out
If you prefer to kick the library's tyres before creating a project, you can use the [`lein try` plugin](https://github.com/rkneufeld/lein-try):

```shell
$ lein try clj-commons/clj-2253
```

or, if you have installed the [Clojure CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools):

```shell
$ clj -Sdeps '{:deps {clj-commons/clj-2253 {:mvn/version "#.#.#"}}}'  # Where #.#.# is replaced with an actual version number
```

Either way, you will be dropped in a REPL with the library downloaded and ready for use.

## Usage

The functionality is provided by a single namespace, `CLJ-2253`, that will work its hacky magic as soon as it's loaded.

Require it in the REPL (incl. a `lein try` REPL):

```clojure
(require '[CLJ-2253])
```

Require it in your project:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [CLJ-2253]))
```

## Tested Versions

<sup>1</sup> I chose to only go back as far as Clojure v1.5.1.  If anyone needs this tested on older versions of Clojure, PRs are welcome!

<sup>2</sup> Leiningen v2.8 only supports JVM v1.7 and up

<sup>3</sup> Clojure v1.10 only supports JVM v1.8 and up
